## SQL with results grid and autocomplete

**What it is:** Run Db2 for i SQL from any `.sql` file or the **SQL scratchpad**.

**Why it helps:**

- Results appear in a grid you can sort, filter, copy or export to CSV.
- Table and column names are suggested as you type, and hovering a column shows its type and description.

**How:**

- **New SQL Scratchpad**, put the cursor in a statement, then press **Ctrl+Enter**.
- Type `FROM ` to get table suggestions and `alias.` to get columns.
- Type `ibmi-` for ready-made IBM i Services queries (jobs, job log, locks, PTFs, message queues).

## Table data editor

**What it is:** A spreadsheet-style editor for any physical file or table.

**Why it helps:**

- It is quicker and safer than DFU or UPDDTA.
- Every value is checked against the column's type and length before anything is written.
- You see a summary and confirm before the changes are saved.

**How:**

- Right-click a file object → **Edit Table Data**, or run the command and type `LIB/FILE`.
- Type a WHERE condition to filter, and use ◀ ▶ to page.
- Click a cell to edit it. Use **+ Row**, **Delete row** and **Set NULL** as needed, then **Save**.
